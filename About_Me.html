    <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
    <p>
        My primary hobby is creating YT gaming videos both on games I like or games<br>
        that are suggested for me to play. My preference is games with strong, developed<br>
        characters and narratives that involve threatening and challenging enemies and<br>
        villains, with a focus on interacting with the characters to learn their story and<br>
        motivations. When making videos on games I play, there's a focus on trying to create<br>
        an immersion in the game and narrative for the viewer. This is accomplished in the<br>
        way I edit those videos and some of the tricks and trends I use that most do not.
    </p>

    <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
    <p>I approach every task with the pretence that it is within my ability to do them, the<br>
        only tasks I can’t do are ones I don’t know how to do now. While at Docutech, sometimes<br>
        an issue would appear that took me a while to solve, even though the solution itself was<br>
        relatively simple. When these issues reappeared, they were solved much quicker as I became<br>
        more familiar with the problems, their causes and solutions.<br><br>
        Aloof is the simplest way to describe how I interact with other people. Making people laugh<br>
        and making sure they are in a pleasant mindset both in and out of work is in my nature. I<br>
        like to build a trusting relationship with people around me and I try to motivate people,<br>
        especially when there’s a seemingly impossible deadline for a larger task. </p>
